# Web Stack Small Project

The purpose of this repository is to provide a very basic code base for
engineering hopefuls to jump into and use their engineering prowess and
creativity to complete the project.


## Project Specification

Included in the `sample_data` folder is an example of purchase orders
often given to us by government organizations. The purpose of this 
project will be to use the existing structure to create a simple
two page search application.

The first page should exist as a landing page in which a potential 
user would enter to begin their search.

The second page should exist as a results page in which the results
of the search will be shown. A user should be able to search and filter
across all fields available.


## Getting Started

To get started with this repo, run the following commands:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver

You should now be able to navigate your browser to http://localhost:8000 

## Deliverables

- Clearly document the additional code you've added
- Clearly document any additional setup that must be done if use additional
  libraries or tools.
- After you're done, we'll set up another call in which we walk through the
  code and workflow that you have developed giving you a chance to explain your
  thought process and design decisions.
